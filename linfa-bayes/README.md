# Naive Bayes

`linfa-bayes` aims to provide pure Rust implementations of Naive Bayes algorithms. 

## The Big Picture

`linfa-bayes` is a crate in the [`linfa`](https://crates.io/crates/linfa) ecosystem, an effort to create a toolkit for classical Machine Learning implemented in pure Rust, akin to Python's `scikit-learn`.

## Current state

`linfa-bayes` currently provides an implementation of the following methods: 

- Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)

## Examples

There is an usage example in the `examples/` directory. To run, use:

```bash
$ cargo run --example winequality 
```
